Welcome to the **E. coli Whole Cell Modelling Data Analysis App**, created to analyse high-throughput time-series WCM simulations of *engineered E. coli* strains expressing a heterologous product

This app allows you to explore the metabolic burden during heterologous expression in E. coli comparing **wildtype** and **variant** simulations.

---

### Pages:

- **Baseline Analysis**  
  Explore wildtype simulation runs, including viability analysis, time-series visualisations, and summary statistics inc. AUC, and mean, max, and min concentrations 

- **Variant Analysis**  
 Explore variant simulation runs, including viability analysis, summary metrics, and time-series visualisations
  

---

### How to Use:
1. Upload your `.pkl` data file and `config.yaml` file on each page.
2. Explore simulations using plots and tables.
3. Use filters to narrow by simulation, metabolite, or repeats

Enjoy your Analysis! â˜º
